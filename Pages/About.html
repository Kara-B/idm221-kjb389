        Hello! My name is Kara Butler and I'm an aspiring UI/UX Designer with a focus on digital design. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree in User Experience and Interaction Design at Drexel University.

        It's no secret that technology gives us a myriad of tools to expand our minds and push our creativity to new heights. Everyday, we learn more ways to utilize its
power to produce more and more fantastic outcomes! As a designer for online content, it is not only my job, but my passion to explore the breadth of
techniques available and use them to the best of my ability to make creative visions a reality.

       I personally believe that good digital design accounts for the needs of both the facilitator of content and those who consume it. The very best
digital design can accomplish this <i>and</i> frame the content in a pleasing and creative format that makes it stand apart from others.
