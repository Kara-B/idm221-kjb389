         Hello! My name is Kara Butler and I'm an aspiring UI/UX Designer with a focus on digital design. I am currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science degree in User Experience and Interaction Design at Drexel University.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's no secret that technology gives us a myriad of tools to expand our minds and push our creativity to new heights. Everyday, we learn more ways to utilize its
power to produce more and more fantastic outcomes! As a designer for online content, it is not only my job, but my passion to explore the breadth of
techniques available and use them to the best of my ability to make creative visions a reality.
    </p>
    <p> I'm more than just a designer, I have other interests!
